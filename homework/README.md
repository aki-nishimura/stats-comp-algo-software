# Instruction on how to complete and submit homework

In this course, you will complete and submit assignments using Git and Github.

To start, [fork this class repo into your Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).
Then complete and submit the first assignment as follows: 
1) make a `hw1` branch from the `main` branch,
2) commit a completed assignment in the `hw1` branch, and
3) create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). 

For a subsequent assignment, [sync up your forked copy](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) before you start the assignment. 
Name the new branch to match the assignment number (e.g. `hw2` for the 2nd assignment).
Otherwise follow the same procedures as above.
