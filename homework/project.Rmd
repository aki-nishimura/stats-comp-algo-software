From the past assignments, you should now have a `hiperglm` package that supports both linear and logistic models, with numerically stable implementation of Newton's method and with performance enhancement via RcppEigen. 

In this assignment, you will extend the `hiperglm` package to support more general regression models.
This is best achieved by recognizing shared structure among generalized linear models and unifying their implementations, re-using as much of the same code as possible and standardizing interfaces to model-specific calculations.
Object-oriented programming is a paradigm well-suited for translating (a part of) this conceptual framework into actual code.
(I say "a part of" because the proposed software design requires a lot more than just object-oriented programming.)
The idea is to have "regression model objects" (e.g. `linear_model`, `logit_model`, etc) handle all the model-specific calculations and operations.

Another aspect of this assignment is to give you practice in reading, modifying, and building on an existing codebase.
Working with others' code is very different from writing code from scratch, as many of us are used to, and is hard work that requires patience and experience.
You will likely spend a lot of time trying to figure out what the code does and wondering what the heck was in the authors' brains when they wrote the code.
Even if the required modification turns out to be only a few lines of code, you might spend days identifying where the modification is needed.
(Incidentally, this is a challenging experience even for professional software engineers starting their career; see this blog post "[Things they didnâ€™t teach you about Software Engineering](https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/things-they-didnt-teach-you/#h-you-rarely-write-something-from-scratch).")

However frustrating it may be to deal with others' code, especially when you are not used to, it is an essential skill if you want to work as a part of a team.
And such collaborative development of software suites will allow you to achieve things you otherwise couldn't by yourself.
To get you started in this path, you will be asked in this assignment to continue the development of `hiperglm` using the instructor's, and _not_ your, implementation of the package.


# Task 0: Make a private copy of the instructor's public `hiperglm` repo

The standard procedure for contributing to/building on others' code would be to fork their repo, work on the forked copy, and open a pull request if you want your work integrated back into the original repo.
For the purpose of this final project, however, there is one minor issue with the above procedure ---
[a fork of a public repo is necessarily public](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-permissions-and-visibility-of-forks#about-visibility-of-forks) and cannot be made private.
This makes it difficult for us to leavve feedback and grade-related info directly in the pull request.
For this reason, you will instead create a private copy of the instructor's public `hiperglm` repo and push all your work this private copy.

More precisely, follow the steps below to set this up:

1. Clone the instructor's repo to your local computer via `git clone https://github.com/aki-nishimura/hiperglm`;
2. Make a private repo, say `hiperglm-final-proj` (or any other suitable name of your choice), on your Github account;
3. Change the URL of the remote `origin` to point to the private repo via `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your_github_username/hiperglm-final-proj`;
4. Invite the instructor and TAs as collaborators so that we can review your pull request.

When you push to the remote with the above set-up, the content of your local git repo will show up in your private Github repo.


# Task 1: Refactor the instructor's `hiperglm` package to use S3 methods for log-likelihood and derivative calculation

Make a `general-model` branch in which you will commit all your work.
The repo as of [this commit](https://github.com/aki-nishimura/hiperglm/tree/logit-model-eigen-cleaned) should be roughly at the same stage of development as your version.
The two subsequent commits set the stage for introducing a "regression model" S3 object and accompanying methods to handle the model-specific calculations required for fitting generalized linear models.

The model-specific calculations are currently handled by functions named `calc_{linear,logit}_*()` for linear and logistic models.
Replace the functions `calc_{linear,logit}_loglik()`, `calc_{linear,logit}_grad()`, and `calc_logit_loglink_deriv()` with S3 generics `calc_loglik()` and `calc_loglink_deriv()` and accompanying S3 methods, where `calc_loglink_deriv()` returns the derivative of the logarithm of the given model's link function.
You additionally need a `calc_grad()` function, but this one should be just a regular function and _not_ an S3 generic.
Use the feature `function(x, y, z, ...)` to support a variable number of arguments in `calc_loglik()`, `calc_grad()`, and  `calc_loglink_deriv()`, which allows you to account for the additional noise variance parameter required for linear model. 
Refer to [the chapter on S3](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html) of Hadley's Advanced R if you need a refresher on the topic.

While and after making the required change, remember to run `devtools::test()` to make sure the package still produces outputs as expected and, if not, to find out where things need fixing.
One important benefit of having comprehensive automated tests is that it allows you to modify code without being afraid of accidentally changing the code's behaviors; the tests will catch them before you publish the change.


# Task 2: Add a support for Poisson regression

The code structure change completed in Task 1 makes it straightforward to support _any_ additional generalized linear model, which now amounts to simply adding functions to compute the corresponding log-likelihood and derivatives of the log-link function.
(To be more precise, any model with log-concave likelihoods for which Newton's method remains effective.)
To see this process in action, you will now add a support for count data via Poisson regression, which users can specify via input argument `model_name = "poisson"` to the `hiper_glm()` function.

In completing this task, remember to apply as appropriate all the best software development practices you learned in this course: 
test-driven development, testing code at different scales from smallest logical units to overall behaviors, expressive and consistent names in functions and variables, modular design/git commits, etc.


# Grading

You will be evaluated on the quality of final code as well as development strategy, the latter of which must be reflected on your git history.

Given the collaborative development aspect of this assignment, you are also asked to re-use as much of the existing code as appropriate and to ensure consistency of what you add with the existing code.
(On the other hand, you should feel free to change whatever deserves to be changed; 
you are just asked not to unnecessarily butcher the provided code.)
This is to emulate a real-life setting of contributing to an existing open-source project, in which it is essential to respect the existing designs and styles the team has established.

To provide one reference point to judge how much of the code should be re-used, a command `git diff --stat pre-task-one..post-task-1` tells me (the instructor) that my personal attempt at Task 1 required 67 lines added and 78 deleted, with most of the additions and deletions being partially modifying the lines (which git still counts as deleting a line and adding a new one).
And the following commands tell me that the change amounts to 179 words added and 292 deleted, as well as to 2,029 characters added and 2,736 deleted.
My deleting one long comment in the code accounts for 103 words and 609 characters, so fewer deletions are related to functionally meaningful changes.
This is obviously just one reference points and less changes aren't necessarily better;
however, if you find yourself making far more changes, it might indicate too much butchering of the existing code and/or too many unwarranted detours.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Replace `pre-task-1` and `post-task-1` with appropriate git commit hashes
git diff --word-diff=porcelain pre-task-1..post-task-1 >> word_diff_out.txt
