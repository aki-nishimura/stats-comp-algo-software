# Problems with stats software landscape

How long does matrix multiplication take in base R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
n <- 4096L
A <- matrix(rnorm(n * n), nrow = n, ncol = n)
B <- matrix(rnorm(n * n), nrow = n, ncol = n)
system.time(A %*% B)
```

... as opposed to Anaconda Python?

```{python, eval=FALSE, python.reticulate=FALSE}
import numpy as np
n = 4096
A = np.random.randn(n, n)
B = np.random.randn(n, n)
%timeit A @ B
```

# Problems with stats software landscape

Many modern data sets are sparsely observed:

```{r}
n_obs <- 5
n_pred <- 3
col_index <- c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3)
row_index <- c(1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1)
sparseMatrix(i = row_index, j = col_index, x = 1)
```

... so most stats packages surely support sparse formats?

---

# Problems with stats software landscape

```{r}
n_obs <- 10^6
n_pred <- 10^4
density <- .01
n_nonzero <- as.integer(n_obs * n_pred * density)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Simulate sparse binary design matrix
row_index <- sample.int(n_obs, n_nonzero, replace = TRUE)
col_index <- sample.int(n_pred, n_nonzero, replace = TRUE)
X <- sparseMatrix(i = row_index, j = col_index, x = 1)
```

--
How much memory to store $X$ in dense format?

```{r}
memory_req_in_gb <- 8 * n_obs * n_pred / 1024^3
sprintf("Dense storage will require %.2gGB.", memory_req_in_gb)
```

# Words from co-founder of Stack Overflow

<p style="margin-top:3ex; line-height:1.2em; font-size:24pt; font-family:garamond;">
&#x201C;Nobody would be surprised if you told them it was hard to do open heart surgery. OK, fine, so maybe software isn't open heart surgery. But it has about the same number of moving parts, it's probably just as complicated, and it's critical in a different way.
</p>

<p style="margin-top:0ex; line-height:1.2em; font-size:24pt; font-family:garamond;">
But there's something weird about designing software specifically: Everybody thinks they know how to do it, even when they have no training. They just think, 'Oh sure, I can do that!'&thinsp;&#x201D;

# So, what's your point, dude?

Software is hard (but thanks Hadley for your help).

--

Computing is hard (can we have a Hadley here?).

--

Statisticians don't even know what they don't know.

--

Statisticians think: <br> 
&emsp; "I do statistics&mdash;let engineers write software." <br>
--
&emsp; "It works on small data, it should work on bigger one."

--

Statisticians have a role to play in the era of "Big Data" <br> 
but don't have skills necessary to directly contribute.

--

_We gotta start changing this._

# On the course design

![:vspace 2ex]

<!-- I wanted to address some of the misconception/confusions, which have been detrimental to the discipline, and actually teach statistical computing. -->

Many "statistical computing" courses focus only on programming and/or algorithms, but 

![:vspace -.5ex]

$$\text{programming} \,\neq\, \text{computing} \,\neq\, \text{algorithm}.$$
<!-- Computing: use of computers to solve mathematical problems. -->
<!-- Computing involves practical implementations of algorithms. -->

--

Software dev skill is also important and complementary, yet previously not covered in a typical stats curriculum.
![:vspace -.5ex]

--

In fact, in terms of utility for a typical student,
![:vspace -.7ex]
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\hspace{-2.6em}\text{software dev} \\
  &\hspace{-1.5em}\geq \text{computing} \\
  &\geq \text{algorithm}.
\end{aligned}
$$

--

![:vspace -.3ex]
This course attempts to teach all three via development of a computationally-intensive statistical software.

<!-- (Additional benefits of this idea: many resources talk about effective software development, but often it's not obvious how to apply them to statistical software, especially computationally-oriented ones. And I get to share some of the best practices I have developed over years.) -->

# Course contents and aims

---

Learning software dev tools (Git, Github, unix tools, etc) for real by actively using them throughout the course.

--

![:vspace 2ex]

Minimal intro to algorithms: ![:vspace -.5ex]
--

- Can't discuss their implementations w/o knowing a bit.
- Helps use existing packages more effectively.
- Provides foundation for further learning.

--

![:vspace 2ex]

Minimal intro to finite prec arithmetic & numerical issues: ![:vspace -.5ex]
--

- Numerical instabilities do arise in practice; <br> worth knowing what causes and how to avoid them.
- Essential for developers of computational software.

---

![:vspace 5ex]

How to optimize code for large-scale applicaitons: ![:vspace -.5ex]

--

* Learn when/what/how (not) to optimize. ![:vspace -.5ex]

--

  - Linking code to right software libralies
  - Introduciton to Rcpp
  - Parallelization opportunities (or lack thereof)

--

* Understand what affects code's performance, <br> rather than blindly reciting e.g. "C(++) is faster than R."
